# FinalProject
My code calculates a number of physics equations

Use the command python3 FinalProject.py (mode) to run the program. Choose one of the modes that appear if the modes are set to "list". Type python3 FinalProject.py and select an item from the list. A usage error appears if the user does not enter a mode. 

Modes/list: shows a list of all the modes that are available

equations: show each physics calculator

root2: calulates a numbers square root

rootx: determines a numbers x root

velocity: is calculated using acceleration and distance traveled based on acceleration calculations

Acceleration: is calculated using intial and final velocities as well as time

Force: is calculated using mass and acceleration

Power is calculated using work and completed time

Density is calculated using Mass and Volume

Potential energy (PE) is calculated using mass, gravity. and height.

Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using mass and velocity

Elastic energy (EE) is calculated using spring constant and extension
